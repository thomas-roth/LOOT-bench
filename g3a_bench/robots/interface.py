"""Robot-agnostic description of a manipulator for the benchmark tasks.

Tasks are written against this interface instead of hardcoding robot details
(site names, collision geom patterns, action scales). Every concrete value
lives in the robot's own ``g3a_bench.robots.<robot>`` package, which exposes a
``get_<robot>_interface()`` factory -- nothing robot-specific belongs in this
module. Tasks consume an instance through the ``wire_manipulator_into_env``
adapter on the task side.
